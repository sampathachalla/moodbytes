# Building Android APK Locally - Step by Step Guide

This document explains how to build an Android APK locally for the MoodBytes React Native Expo project.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Android SDK Setup
The Android SDK was already installed via Android Studio, located at:
```
~/Library/Android/sdk
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Set up the following environment variables:
```bash
export ANDROID_HOME=~/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

## Step-by-Step Build Process

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
cd /Users/sampath/Desktop/MoodBytes/Template
npm install
```

### Step 2: Fix Missing Splash Screen Resources
The build initially failed because the splash screen logo was referenced in the Android styles but the drawable resource didn't exist.

**Problem**: 
- `android/app/src/main/res/values/styles.xml` referenced `@drawable/splashscreen_logo`
- But the actual drawable files were missing from the drawable directories

**Solution**: Copy the splash screen logo from assets to all drawable density directories:
```bash
cp assets/images/splashscreen_logo.png android/app/src/main/res/drawable-hdpi/splashscreen_logo.png
cp assets/images/splashscreen_logo.png android/app/src/main/res/drawable-mdpi/splashscreen_logo.png
cp assets/images/splashscreen_logo.png android/app/src/main/res/drawable-xhdpi/splashscreen_logo.png
cp assets/images/splashscreen_logo.png android/app/src/main/res/drawable-xxhdpi/splashscreen_logo.png
cp assets/images/splashscreen_logo.png android/app/src/main/res/drawable-xxxhdpi/splashscreen_logo.png
```

### Step 3: Build the APK
Navigate to the android directory and run the Gradle build command:
```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

## Build Configuration

## Build Output

### Successful Build Result
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions:

1. **Missing Splash Screen Resources**
   - **Error**: `resource drawable/splashscreen_logo not found`
   - **Solution**: Copy splash screen logo to all drawable density directories

2. **Android SDK Not Found**
   - **Error**: `ANDROID_HOME not set`
   - **Solution**: Set environment variables as shown in Prerequisites

3. **Gradle Build Failures**
   - **Solution**: Clean build and try again:
     ```bash
     cd android
     ./gradlew clean
     ./gradlew assembleRelease
     ```

## Build Commands Summary

```bash
# Set up environment
export ANDROID_HOME=~/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Fix splash screen resources
cp assets/images/splashscreen_logo.png android/app/src/main/res/drawable-hdpi/splashscreen_logo.png
cp assets/images/splashscreen_logo.png android/app/src/main/res/drawable-mdpi/splashscreen_logo.png
